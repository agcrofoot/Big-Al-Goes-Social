        <p>Big Al's 321 Social Media site came about after it was assigned to the MIS 321 class.
            This one in particular was the work of Alexandra Crofoot. She spent many hours on it when she wasn't working on the other project in the class.
            It wasn't easy, it took days for Alexandra to figure out how to get the friggin edit function to work. But like all great success stories, she eventually figured
            it out. So move over Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, here comes Big Al!!</p>
